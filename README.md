# Visualization of the Global Genome Structure

### The task was to visually represent the genomic diversity of 4 continents (Africa, America, Asia and Europe) using their Chromosome 1 data

### The objective of the task is to generate a plot which depicts the diversity of the world's genome and show a need for more inclusion in sequencing projects

#### The task was completed using the following softwares:
1.  PLINK (to generate the eigenvalues)
2.  R (to generate the plot using ggplot)

#### Project.sh contains commands used on the linux server to collect data and generate eigenvalues
#### project.R contains codes used to generate the plot
#### ggplot.png is the image of the PCA plot
#### Project Report contains the methods used and implication of the result
